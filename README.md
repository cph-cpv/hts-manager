# hts-manager

An internal tool for managing Illumina sequencing run output and getting reads
into Virtool. Point it at a directory of Illumina run folders; it indexes the
`*.fastq.gz` / `*.fq.gz` files (name, size, and run metadata parsed from the
run-folder name + filename), and presents a searchable list behind a shared PIN.
Each row has a one-click **Upload** button; a background worker uploads queued
files one at a time to Virtool, survives restarts, and marks each file
`uploaded` on success.

Originally scoped as a short-lived internal tool, hts-manager is now on a path
to become a production service for the sequencing pipeline — see
[Roadmap](#roadmap) for where it's headed.

See [`plan.md`](./plan.md) for the original design and rationale.

## Stack

TanStack Start (React 19, Router + Query), TypeScript, Vite, better-sqlite3,
zod, undici + form-data, Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui. Package manager: pnpm.
Node 24.

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in HTSM_PIN, HTSM_SESSION_SECRET, HTSM_SCAN_PATH, VT_* creds
pnpm dev               # http://localhost:3000

# production
pnpm build && pnpm start
```

On boot the app scans `HTSM_SCAN_PATH` once, then keeps the file list and the two
top-bar indicators (scanning / upload activity) live; **Scan now** re-scans on
demand.

## Configuration

All configuration is via env vars — see [`.env.example`](./.env.example); there
are no CLI options. Required to boot are `HTSM_PIN` and `HTSM_SESSION_SECRET`;
the `VT_UPLOAD_*` credentials are only validated once an upload actually runs.

### Access

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `HTSM_PIN` | Yes | — | Shared access PIN. Anyone who knows it gets a signed session cookie. Compared in constant time. |
| `HTSM_SESSION_SECRET` | Yes | — | HMAC-SHA256 secret used to sign the session cookie. Use a long random string. |

### Storage

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `HTSM_SCAN_PATH` | No | _(unset)_ | Directory of Illumina run folders to scan. If unset, the startup scan is skipped and the file list stays empty until set. |
| `HTSM_DB_PATH` | No | `./hts-manager.db` | Path to the better-sqlite3 database file. |

### Virtool upload target

These are only read when an upload runs. `VT_UPLOAD_USER_HANDLE` and
`VT_UPLOAD_API_KEY` must both be set or the upload throws.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `VT_UPLOAD_URL` | No | `https://preview.virtool.ca/api/uploads` | Endpoint the uploader `POST`s each file to. |
| `VT_UPLOAD_USER_HANDLE` | To upload | — | Virtool username, sent as HTTP Basic auth user. |
| `VT_UPLOAD_API_KEY` | To upload | — | Virtool personal access token, sent as HTTP Basic auth password. |
| `VT_UPLOAD_FILE_TYPE` | No | `reads` | Value of the `type` query param on the upload request. |

### Runtime

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `HTSM_SECURE` | No | `true` | Controls the `Secure` flag on the session cookie. Set to `false` only when serving over plain HTTP (e.g. by IP on a trusted, cert-less network) — browsers silently drop `Secure` cookies set over non-HTTPS connections, which otherwise makes the PIN login appear to silently fail. |

## How metadata is derived

Everything is parsed from the **run-folder name + filename** — no file is
decompressed, so scanning is fast.

- A run folder is a **direct child of the scan root** whose name matches the
  Illumina pattern (`230615_A00123_0456_BHGV7DSX3` → date `2023-06-15`,
  instrument `A00123`, run `0456`, flowcell `BHGV7DSX3`). The date must be
  followed by a full instrument/run/flowcell tail; partial names like `230615`
  or `230615_A00123` do not match.
- Lane comes from the filename `_L00N_` token (null for merged outputs).
- Top-level directories that don't match the run-folder pattern are **skipped
  wholesale**, as are files not under a recognized run folder — keep the tree
  conforming. Such files are *not lost*, just not indexed.
- mtime is intentionally ignored: this data has been copied/reorganized, so
  neither filesystem nor gzip-header mtime reflects the actual run date.

## Upload protocol

A single `POST` to `VT_UPLOAD_URL` (no chunking, no server-side resume): HTTP
Basic auth, `name`/`type` query params, `multipart/form-data` with field `file`,
success = HTTP `201`. "Resume" therefore means re-POSTing an interrupted file
whole on restart.

## Project status

Feature-complete against [`plan.md`](./plan.md): DB layer, run-folder/filename
parsing, in-process scanner + uploader workers, single-PIN auth, status/file
server functions, and the file-list UI with top-bar indicators. This covers the
original short-lived-tool scope; active development has moved on to the
production-hardening work tracked in [Roadmap](#roadmap).

## Roadmap

Planned as hts-manager grows from a stopgap script into a production service:

- **Active run visibility** — surface in-progress sequencing runs, not just
  completed ones.
- **Automatic handling of done runs** — sequencers write to a target
  directory; hts-manager detects completed runs and copies them to long-term
  storage automatically.
- **Whole-run upload to Virtool** — upload a run's files as a unit, with the
  ability to tag a run for auto-upload before it finishes sequencing.
- **`Undetermined` file exclusion from upload** — excluded by default, with a
  per-run opt-out.
- **Samplesheet parsing** — read samplesheets from run folders when present,
  to enrich run metadata.
